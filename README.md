svg-art-generator
=================

Tool for generating chuck close style art, where small svg squares are mapped to pixels.

To use, drag an image (ideally gif) composed of a small set of colors (like 2) into the draggable square.

You will then see the color palette generated beneath.

Drag SVG squares (50px x 50px) onto these color palettes to map them to this pixel, you can drag as many as you like.

Click Generate to build it based on the pixel mapping.
